This project involves building a system that generates descriptive captions for images by combining deep learning techniques. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image feature extraction and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for generating text, the system translates visual content into meaningful sentences. The project showcases the integration of computer vision and natural language processing, with potential applications in accessibility tools, content generation, and multimedia search engines.
